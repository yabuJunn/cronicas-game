## Blends the albedo Color of the decal with albedo Color of the underlying mesh.
## This can be set to 0.0 to create a decal that only affects normal or ORM. In
## this case, an albedo texture is still required as its alpha channel will

## Specifies which render layers this decal will project on. By default, Decals
## affect all layers. This is used so you can specify which types of objects
## receive the Decal and which do not. This is especially useful so you can
## ensure that dynamic objects don't accidentally receive a Decal intended for
## the terrain under them.

## Fades the Decal if the angle between the Decal's AABB and the target surface
## becomes too large. A value of 0 projects the Decal regardless of angle, a
## value of 1 limits the Decal to surfaces that are nearly perpendicular.

## Sets the size of the AABB used by the decal. All dimensions must be set to a

## If true, decals will smoothly fade away when far from the active Camera3D,
## and eventually be culled and not sent to the shader at all. Use this to reduce
## the number of active Decals in a scene and thus improve performance.

## The amount by which the depth of this decal will be adjusted when sorting by depth.
## Uses the same units as the engine (which are typically meters). Adjusting it to a
## higher value will make the decal reliably draw on top of other decals that are
## otherwise positioned at the same spot. To ensure it always draws on top of other
## objects around it (not positioned at the same spot), set the value to be greater than
##  the distance between this decal and the other nearby decals.
